# Big-Data-HandWritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-Map-Reduce

<b>Programming Language :</b> Java<br>

<b>Big Data Framework used :</b> Map-Reduce<br>

<b>Dataset :</b> MNIST Handwritten digit recognition dataset<br>

## Project Description

Due to increasing scale of data and increase in response time, complex deep learning
algorithms, even though we have high accuracy around 95-98%, we have having challenges in
getting the output quickly as desired. In order to address this challenge, in this project, we will
be combining technologies from Machine Learning as well as Big Data so that we cannot not
only get accurate results but also get the results quickly. During the course of the project, we will
be using Map-reduce framework in order to complete the project in a distributed fashion. This
project can be very useful in various application where we need to read car number plates,
visiting cards, handwritten page documents, etc.
